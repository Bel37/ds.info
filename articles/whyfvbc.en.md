# Why Free Virtual Belarussian Community
1. We see that the representative democracy and related forms of goverment have often compromised themselves in most countries with weak civil societies.
2. Representative democracy is a trade-off between the old authoritarian models and full democracy in wich small and united groups of people are able to push their agenda to the detriment of majority interests. 
2. In such countries existing form of election can be compromised with falsifications and manipulations.
3. On the other hand the main function of government is legalization of economic relationships and protection of human rights.
4. We believe, that any human is capable to be responsible for his- or herself, in contrast to retoric of any totalitarian or dictatorial government and their supporters.
5. Also we see, that the formal group organized by Alexander Lukashenko, who monopolized government functions in the Republic of Belarus, while lost credibility of the people and capability to perform fucntions from statment 3.
6. So we are going to use modern technologies to give Belarusian people capability to organize themselves into vritual sociaty that will replace services and functions that are usually provided by a classical government.
7. Functionality of Free Virtual Belarussian Community is based on direct and liquid democracies.\
New forms of deliberative inclusive democracy are needed to prevent Belarusians from being manipulated by the illegitimate government of today and possible subsequent "classical" model governments.\
The tools needed to rework the faulty and dictatorship and vested interests-prone are in existance and are not in use solely due to inertia. So the Belarusian people have unique opprotunity to implement it due to interest to plicals.
